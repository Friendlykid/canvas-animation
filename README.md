# Canvas Animation

A TypeScript-based animation generator that creates video animations synchronized with MIDI music data. This project generates frame-by-frame PNG images from a source image with camera movements and effects, then combines them with audio to create a final video that is built from individual frames with ffmpeg

## Features

- **MIDI Processing**: Parse and analyze MIDI files to extract musical events
- **Canvas Animation**: Generate smooth camera movements and zoom effects
- **Frame Generation**: Create individual PNG frames for video compilation
- **Audio Synchronization**: Combine generated frames with audio tracks
